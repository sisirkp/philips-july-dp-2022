Smells:
1. OnlineCart is a God Class. It has knowledge of all types of payment processings
2. THe name OnlineCart suggests it will have item details as well and item related functionality e.g. add,remove etc. Including that it has payment knowledge so violtes SRP


Refactoring Proposal:
1. Remove Payment details to separate class
2. Use Stratergy pattern to decide payment methods

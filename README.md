//C++ Code
bool batteryIsOk(float temperature, float soc, float chargeRate) {
  if(temperature < 0 || temperature > 45) {
    cout << "Temperature out of range!\n";
    return false;
  } else if(soc < 20 || soc > 80) {
    cout << "State of Charge out of range!\n";
    return false;
  } else if(chargeRate > 0.8) {
    cout << "Charge Rate out of range!\n";
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}

Findings:
The code is violating Single Responsibility Principle on the following points:
1. The method has 3 responsiblites:
    temperature, soc, chargeRate
2. Validation loic for any one of the above changes will result in a change in the method
3. Individual ifs which are testing for 2 conditions are not violation of SRP in themselves as they deal with the same parameter
